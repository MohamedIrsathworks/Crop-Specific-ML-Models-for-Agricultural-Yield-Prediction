# Crop-Specific-ML-Models-for-Agricultural-Yield-Prediction
This project builds machine learning models to predict agricultural yield using structured crop data and engineered features. Unlike previous approaches, it avoids redundancy by removing Production and Area as inputs, focusing on normalized metrics like Fertilizer per Area to improve model accuracy and generalization.
